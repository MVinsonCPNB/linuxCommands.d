base64 is used to encode and decode streams of characters
for example:
   base64 <<< linux-training.be
prints: bGludXgtdHJaW5pbmcuYmUK
Explination:  This is the encoded version of linux-training.be

Note: there are two ways of passing informtion to the base64 command
the <<< is called "here string' and the echo linux-training.be | base64
is another way of executing the command, except this way uses one more
process then using the here string.
