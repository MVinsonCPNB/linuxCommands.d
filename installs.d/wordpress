Detailed Instructions
Step 1: Download and Extract
Download and unzip the WordPress package from https://wordpress.org/download/.

If you will be uploading WordPress to a remote web server, download the WordPress package to your computer with a web browser and unzip the package.
If you will be using FTP, skip Step 2 and go to the next step - uploading files is covered later.
If you have shell access to your web server, and are comfortable using console-based tools, you may wish to download WordPress directly to your web server using wget (or lynx or another console-based web browser) if you want to avoid FTPing:
wget https://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz
Then unzip the package using: 
tar -xzvf latest.tar.gz 

The WordPress package will extract into a folder called wordpress in the same directory that you downloaded latest.tar.gz.
Step 2: Create the Database and a User
If you are using a hosting provider, you may already have a WordPress database set up for you, or there may be an automated setup solution to do so. Check your hosting provider's support pages or your control panel for clues about whether or not you'll need to create one manually.

If you determine that you'll need to create one manually, follow the instructions for accessing phpMyAdmin on various servers, or follow the instructions for Using Plesk, Using cPanel or Using phpMyAdmin below.

If you are installing WordPress on your own web server, follow the Using phpMyAdmin or Using the MySQL Client instructions below to create your WordPress username and database.

If you have only one database and it is already in use, you can install WordPress in it - just make sure to have a distinctive prefix for your tables to avoid over-writing any existing database tables.
