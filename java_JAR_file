" A JAR file is a Java ARchiver.  It's based on the pkzip file format, and
    it lets you bundle all your classes so that instead of presenting your
    client with 28 class files, you hand over just a single JAR file.  If
    you're familiar with the tar command on UNIX, you'll recognize the jar
    tool commands.

    1.) Make sure all of your class files are in the classes directory

    2.) Create a manifest.txt file that states which class has the 
        main() method
            
            Main-Class: MyApp ("NOTE: press the return key here")

    3.) Run the jar tool to create a JAR file that contains everything
        in the classes directory, plus the manifest

        $cd MyProject/classes
        $jar -cvmf manifest.txt app1.jar *.class
                        OR
        $jar -cvmf manifest.txt app1.jar MyApp.class

    4.) Run a jar file 
            java -jar app1.jar
