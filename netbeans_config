# When a Java update takes place on fedora you may have to enter the netbeans configuration and point to the new java installed if the older version was removed.  

For Example: 

Navigate to netbeans-8.2/etc/netbeans.conf

netbeans_jdkhome="/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0-openjdk-1.8.0.172-12.b11.fc27.x86_64"

Locate follow the path and see if the JVM still exists, if not change the path to point to a new JVM.
