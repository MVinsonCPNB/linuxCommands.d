You should set necessary directory permissions. For directories they are:

read: permitted to view files and sub-directories in that directory
write: permitted to create files and sub-directories in that directory
execute: permitted to enter into a directory.
For files the situation is similar, it's quite obvious, so you can handle it on your own.

Numeric these permissions:

read - 4
write - 2
execute - 1
To edit permissions use chmod. Usage: chmod xyz <file or directory>

x - the sum of owner permissions
y - the sum of owner group permissions
z - the sum of rest users/groups permissions
Example:

$ chmod -R 664 /home/jack/
jack and jack's group will have read+write access to /home/jack and all it's sub-directories. The rest will have only read access. -R option here used to recursively set permissions.

Other example:

$ chmod 700 /home/jack/video/
will give jack full access to /home/jack/videodirectory. See also: chown, chgrp for changing owner and owning group.
