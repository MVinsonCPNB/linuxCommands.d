Assuming that your shell is Bash (the default in Ubuntu), these are the differences:

    When running as a login shell, Bash will read ~/.bash_profile (or, if that doesn't exist, ~/.profile) on startup. In some cases, this file reads ~/.bashrc as well.

    When running as a non-login shell, Bash will read ~/.bashrc.

So, why do you see different behaviors when running as a login/non-login shell? Because your .bash_profile/.profile is doing different things than your .bashrc.

The solution I would recommend in your case is to copy the customizations made to .bash_profile/.profile, paste them into .bashrc and disable "Run command as a login shell".
