# various rvm commands

#To install a new version of ruby 

rvm install 1.9.2

	OR

rvm install jruby



#switch to a different ruby version 

rvm use 1.9.2



#switch back to system ruby

rvm system


*********************************************************
#Project Specific Ruby and Gems
	--You could switch to a project directory
	 and have the correct Ruby implementation loaded?
	--You could isolate gems between projects?
By placing a .rvmrc file into the root directory of 
a project you can have project specific ruby and gems

For example, a project using Ruby Enterprise Edition
Project Name myProject

-- create .rvmrc in ~/myProject/.rvmrc

-- within the .rvmrc
ree@myProject

-- (above) reads ruby enterprise edition for myProject

Another example is if the project used JRuby then,
-- within the .rvmrc
jruby@mySecondProject

#When changing to the directory with a .rvmrc file specified
#, rvm will load or install the specified version of ruby.

#Next, is to create a gemset for the project

-- a prompt should be displayed asking to create a gemset
rvm gemset create 'myProject'

*********************************************************

#View the path where a projects gem files are loacted

gem env gemdir
	-- if a gemset is defined it should be an isolated env
