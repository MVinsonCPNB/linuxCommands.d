Example: 
echo level5 | sed 's/5/43/'
level43

Example2:
echo level5 level7 | sed 's/level/jump/g'
(by adding the g to the end both occurrences of level will be replaced)
OUTPUT:

Example:
(whole lines contain a pattern can be removed)

cat tennis.txt | sed '/BE/d'
(this will search tennis.txt for the BE occurrence and remove the line from 
the displaying on the screen)
