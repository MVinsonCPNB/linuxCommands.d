The tail command will view the end of a file's lines
one feature is the -f option which keeps the file 
open and when another process adds to the file 
it will printout to screen:

Example:
tailing.txt
tail -f tailing.txt
hello
world

in the other shell:
echo hello >> tailing.txt
echo world >> tailing.txt

Example: 
tail -3 [filename].txt (will display the last 4 lines of the file)
