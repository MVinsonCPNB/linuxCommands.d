tee is a filter 
it takes stdin stream and outputs the stream to stdout and stdin
therefore, the a file can be created and while passing the stream
to another pipe, see example below.
Example:
tac count.txt | tee temp.txt | tac

Explination: 
the contents of count is read by tac backward and passed to tee
. tee then saves the recieved output to a file and passes the 
stream to tac again which then reverses the count.txt back into
its orininal order, and displays the on screen using stdout (1>)
