tr command translates the characters as they appear in the stream
for example: 
tr 'ow' '45' < text.txt
     if text.txt holds the values: one, two
then the result will be
     4ne, t5o

Using a pipe with the translate command 
cat tennis.txt | tr 'e' 'E'
OUTPUT:
reads the contents of tennis.txt and changes every e into an E.
